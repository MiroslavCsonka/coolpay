Scenario
 
Coolpay is a new company that allows to easily send money to friends through their API.
 
You work for Fakebook, a successful social network. Youâ€™ve been tasked to integrate Coolpay inside Fakebook. A/B tests show that users prefer to receive money than pokes!
 
You can find Coolpay documentation here: http://docs.coolpayapi.apiary.io/
 
You will write a small app that uses Coolplay API in Ruby. The app should be able do the following:
 
- Authenticate to Coolpay API
- Add recipients
- Send them money
- Check whether a payment was successful
 
Username: <MiroslavC>
API Key: <A82CE33E0D78C656>
 
Once you have completed the app please send it across to us (up to you how you do this - zip attachment, github/bitbucket etc).
